# hyperledger-public

This repository allows a user to:

1. create a sample hyperledger network using hyperledgernetwork project.
2. run a two-node end to end test against the network.

The test is intended to show issues occurring after long wait periods between commits on a multi-orderer (kafka-based) hyperledger.
